  // to update an array without mutating the original use one of the following methods

  // make a copy with the slice array method
  let team2 = team.slice();
  team2[1] = 'Mr. Bojangles';
  console.log(starters, team, team2); 

  // use the ES6 spread method

  const person = {
    name: 'Geoff',
    age: 38,
    gender: 'Male'

  // const captain = person;
  // captain.number = 99;

  // use the assign method to copy the object. NOTE: This technique is very shallow; it will only go one level deep. Meaning, the cloning will only affect the first level of depth in the object.
  const captain = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 12, number: 99});
